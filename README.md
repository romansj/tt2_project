# tt2_project "AmaChef"

Three students participate in the assignment:
- Elvis Stapkēvičs(es19099)
- Kaspars Pudāns(kp19066)
- Jānis Romāns (jr19025)

### Description
- It is planned to develop a recipe sharing platform called “AmaChef”. It will be a website where users can post recipes, view, rate and comment on recipes posted by other users. The poster will have to show the quantity (servings or amount) of food produced so other users can use the inbuilt calculator to calculate the amount of food they will make.
- The user will also be able to add photos and videos to their recipe. Users will also be able to save recipes to their collections and will be able to search for recipes with a search bar.
- The main page will consist of the “hottest” recipes, the highest rated recipes that are posted recently, there will also be a “hall of fame” that will consist of the most viewed and most highly rated recipes and a “fresh” section, where the newest recipes will be posted.

### User Authentication
- Users can register by entering their email address and password. The email address has to be verified. A code is sent to the address which the user must then enter on the website.
- Users can also register using their Facebook or Google account. After registration they can use “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with Facebook” for a one-click sign in. Existing users can link their account to their Facebook or Google account.
